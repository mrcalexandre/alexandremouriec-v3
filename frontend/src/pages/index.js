              I am Alexandre Mouriec, recent graduate in Computer Science and
              Web Development at the IUT of Lannion.
              <br />
              Curious and passionate about tech startups, programming and
              more... I am always excited to discover a new field or topic. I
              love making things so I often work on side-projects. These
              projects help me learn new skills like programming skills and
              solve problems.
              <br />I had the chance to work with amazing companies and talented
              people over the last few years. There, I worked autonomously,
              sometimes remotely on small to really big projects. I love working
              in fast-paced startups trying to solve big problems.
